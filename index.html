        Your Commute

      <p>
        How do all of these factors affect your commute? 
        Click and drag on the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".map" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">map</a>
        from a starting station to an ending station to see a detailed breakdown of how long that trip takes at different points during a typical workday.
        The
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.top" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">points on top</a>
        show all of the trip durations for a given starting time from the start to destination and the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.bottom" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">points on bottom</a>
        show all of the times between when when trains leave the start station going to the destination station.
        The time between trains is the longest you would possibly need to wait if you arrived just as the previous train was leaving.
        The 
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".top.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">blue band</a>
        excludes the shortest and longest 10% of all transit times, leaving behind the most-likely 80% range and the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".bottom.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">orange band</a>
        does the same for wait times between trains.
        The 
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".p50" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">dark lines</a>
        show the middle point where 50% of the time wait/transit times are higher and 50% of the time they are lower.

        In general, delays go up during rush hour but trains come more frequently, for example if you look at
        <a href="#" data-start="place-sstat" data-end="place-knncl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">South Station to Kendall/MIT</a>
        you will notice that the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.top, .top.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">transit times</a>
        go up as the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.bottom, .bottom.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">wait times</a>
        go down.
        If you drag across the chart, the paragraph below will tell you that these effects roughly balance eachother out and the most-likely trip duration (half the normal time between trains plus total transit time) stays constant around 10-12 minutes.
        It is also interesting to note that transit times on the blue line, for example
        <a href="#" data-start="place-state" data-end="place-wondl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">State St. to Wonderland</a>
        are much less variable than the red line.
        Orange line trips like
        <a href="#" data-start="place-dwnxg" data-end="place-forhl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">Downtown Crossing to Forest Hills</a>
        are less variable in transit time - but trains come much less frequently and reliably.
