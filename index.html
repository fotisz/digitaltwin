        The People
      </h3>
      <p>In a typical weekday, 425,000 people enter a station along the red, orange, or blue lines.  On weekends and holidays, that number drops to 200,000.  The busiest day was Friday February 7 when 470,187 people entered the system.</p>
      <p>
        This heatmap shows the average number of people that
        <a href="#" class="hover-link dim" data-dim="exits">enter</a>
        and
        <a href="#" class="hover-link dim" data-dim="entrances">exit</a>
        stations along the red, orange, and blue line for every hour over the entire month based on records from turnstiles at each station.  Each row represents one week. You can see weekends and weekdays with daily peaks at rush hour, as well as
        <a href="#" class="hover-link highlight-total" data-highlight="holidays">a holiday</a>,
        and
        <a href="#" class="hover-link highlight-total" data-highlight="snow">two snow storms</a>.
        Our exit data is less reliable since not all stations require that people exit through a turnstile.

        The

        show all of the times between when when trains leave the start station going to the destination station.
        The time between trains is the longest you would possibly need to wait if you arrived just as the previous train was leaving.
        The 
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".top.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">blue band</a>

        The

        In general, delays go up during rush hour but trains come more frequently, for example if you look at
        <a href="#" data-start="place-sstat" data-end="place-knncl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">South Station to Kendall/MIT</a>
        you will notice that the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.top, .top.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">transit times</a>
        go up as the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.bottom, .bottom.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">wait times</a>
        go down.
        If you drag across the chart, the paragraph below will tell you that these effects roughly balance eachother out and the most-likely trip duration (half the normal time between trains plus total transit time) stays constant around 10-12 minutes.
        It is also interesting to note that transit times on the blue line, for example
        <a href="#" data-start="place-state" data-end="place-wondl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">State St. to Wonderland</a>
        are much less variable than the red line.
        Orange line trips like
        <a href="#" data-start="place-dwnxg" data-end="place-forhl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">Downtown Crossing to Forest Hills</a>
        are less variable in transit time - but trains come much less frequently and reliably.
