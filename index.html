      <p>Boston’s Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) operates the 4th busiest subway system in the U.S. after New York, Washington, and Chicago.  If you live in or around the city you have probably ridden on it.  The MBTA recently began publishing substantial amount of subway data through its public APIs.  They provide the full schedule in General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) format which powers Google’s transit directions.  They also publish realtime train locations for the Red, Orange, Blue, and Green lines.  The following visualizations use data captured from these feeds for the entire month of February, 2014.  <a href="http://mbtaviz.github.io/green-line-release" target="_blank">Green Line data became available</a> in October, 2014 so is not shown here.  Also, working with the MBTA, we were able to acquire per-minute entry and exit counts at each station measured at the turnstiles used for payment.</p>
      <p>We attempt to present this information to help people in Boston better understand the trains, how people use the trains, and how the people and trains interact with each other.</p>

          <p>In a typical weekday, trains make approximately 1150 trips on the red, orange, and blue lines starting at 5AM and continuing through 1AM the next morning.  On Saturdays trains make 870 trips and on Sundays they make 760.</p>

          <p>To better understand how the trains operate on a typical day, below are all trips that trains took on the red, orange, and blue lines on Monday February 3 2014.  Each vertical line represents a station, and time extends from top to bottom.  Steeper lines indicate slower trains.  This visualization was first used by Étienne-Jules Marey to visualize train schedules and is typically called a “Marey Diagram.”</p>

          To better compare the individual trips on this day, the visualization below shows all of the trips from the above diagram juxtaposed with the the starting points lined up so you can see the range of fastest to slowest trips, as well as variation in trip times based on the time of day.
          The trains slow down a little bit during the
          <a href="#" data-lo="7" data-hi="10" class="hover-link lined-up-highlight">morning rush-hour</a>,
          primarily on the outbound blue line.  The
          <a href="#" data-lo="16" data-hi="19" class="hover-link lined-up-highlight">afternoon rush-hour</a>
          is by-far the worst time of day for the red line.  The
          <a href="#" data-lo="10" data-hi="16" class="hover-link lined-up-highlight">midday lull</a>
          and

          are both fairly consistent.  Hover over the time scale on the left to highlight trips during different parts of the day.  Click on a line to see all at what time the train was at each stop.

        The time between trains is the longest you would possibly need to wait if you arrived just as the previous train was leaving.

        In general, delays go up during rush hour but trains come more frequently, for example if you look at
        <a href="#" data-start="place-sstat" data-end="place-knncl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">South Station to Kendall/MIT</a>
        you will notice that the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.top, .top.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">transit times</a>
        go up as the
        <a href="#" data-highlight=".circle.bottom, .bottom.range" class="hover-link pick-two-highlight">wait times</a>
        go down.
        If you drag across the chart, the paragraph below will tell you that these effects roughly balance eachother out and the most-likely trip duration (half the normal time between trains plus total transit time) stays constant around 10-12 minutes.
        It is also interesting to note that transit times on the blue line, for example
        <a href="#" data-start="place-state" data-end="place-wondl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">State St. to Wonderland</a>
        are much less variable than the red line.
        Orange line trips like
        <a href="#" data-start="place-dwnxg" data-end="place-forhl" class="click-link pick-two-choose">Downtown Crossing to Forest Hills</a>
        are less variable in transit time - but trains come much less frequently and reliably.
